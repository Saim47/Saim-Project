Number Guessing Game in Python
This mini-project is a fun and interactive Number Guessing Game built using Python.
The game randomly selects a target number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess it.
After each guess, the game provides feedback, letting the player know if their guess was too high, too low, or correct.
The player can choose to continue guessing until they succeed or type "Quit" to exit the game.
This project is a great example of using loops, conditionals, and input handling in Python,
perfect for beginners learning coding fundamentals!
